### What is DevOps:
DevOps is a culture created to merge the world of Dev to Ops.

While adopting DevOps practices automates and optimizes processes through technology, it all starts with the culture within the organization and the people who are part of it. The challenge of cultivating a DevOps culture requires profound changes in the way people work and collaborate. However, when organizations commit to this challenge, they can create the ideal environment for developing high-performing teams.
### What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure:
Automation is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the modern world and has countless applications, including: enterprise applications such as business process automation (BPA), AIOps, and enterprise automation, industrial automation applications such as robotics used in automotive manufacturing, and consumer applications such as home automation.

Software scalability is the ability to grow or shrink a piece of software to meet changing demands on a business.

Software infrastructure is a type of enterprise, either a software or a program, specifically designed to help business organizations perform fundamental tasks like business transactions, workforce support, internal services, processes, etc.
### Why DevOps is Important:
DevOps enables previously siloed functions—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to act in a coordinated and collaborative manner to generate better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture in conjunction with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and meet business goals faster.
