# Solution

Linux shell scripting involves writing programs (scripts) that can be run by a Linux shell, such as bash (Bourne Again Shell). These scripts automate tasks, perform system administration tasks, and facilitate the interaction between users and the operating system.

**Tasks:**

- Explain in your own words and with examples what Shell Scripting means for DevOps.
- What is `#!/bin/bash`? Can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
- Write a Shell Script that prints `I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge`.
- Write a Shell Script that takes user input, input from arguments, and prints the variables.
- Provide an example of an If-Else statement in Shell Scripting by comparing two numbers.
